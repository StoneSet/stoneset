### Hi there 👋, I'm StoneSet !

I'm a electronic and technology hobbyist, I like to spend my time on project like [RetroBox](https://retrobox.tech) or [Thingmill](https://thingmill.fr) (and even on stupid one lol). 

- 🔭 I’m currently working at Thingmill as lead electronic designer for the RetroBox project with [@lefuturiste](https://github.com/lefuturiste/) { *Go check is Github, it's a really nice guy* }.

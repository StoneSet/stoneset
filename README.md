### Hi there 👋, I'm StoneSet!

I'm an electronics and technology hobbyist. I enjoy spending my time on projects like [DLRaudio](https://dlr-audio.com) and [Thingmill](https://thingmill.fr)—and sometimes on fun, quirky ones too! 😄

🔭 **Current Work:**  
I’m a telecom engineer at Orange Business, still collaborating with [@lefuturiste](https://github.com/lefuturiste/) on projects at @Thingmill.

🎶 **Other Passions:**  
I'm also passionate about acoustics and metrology, and I run a website called [dlr-audio.com](https://dlr-audio.com), where I share speaker/headphone tests, and technical insights related to HiFi audio.
